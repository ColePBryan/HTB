The code is written to block buffer overflow from the review being written by the user. This buffer overflow prevention is attempted by counting the number of characters the user provided, and then if it is less than the allowed input size it copies it over. Unfortunately the array is not sized by number of characters, instead it is sized by number of bytes. Not all characters are 1 byte. As seen in the payload an emoji can be used to reach the end of the vector and start over-writting the "hardcoded" pin. The first payload characters are just 4-byte utf characters. The characters after that are the desired pin. Connect to the target using `nc [host] [port]` enter `1` insert the payload, press `2` and the shell should be open. Now it is just a matter of finding the flag and issuing a `cat {flag file}`.
